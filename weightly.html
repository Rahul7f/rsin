    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Weightly</strong> ("we", "our", or "the App") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use our mobile application. Weightly is an offline-first personal weight tracker. Protecting your privacy is important to us — this policy explains what data is handled and how.</p>

    <h2>1. Summary — key points</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Offline by default:</strong> All weight entries and settings are stored locally on your device.</li>
      <li><strong>No account required:</strong> Weightly does not require you to create an account or sign in.</li>
      <li><strong>User-controlled backups:</strong> Backup and export features generate files you control (CSV/JSON). We do not receive these files.</li>
      <li><strong>Optional features:</strong> Reminders (local notifications), in-app purchases (Premium), and third-party ads (AdMob) are optional. See details below.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Information stored locally</h3>
    <p>When you use Weightly, the following information is stored on your device:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Weight entries:</strong> recorded weight values, timestamps/dates, optional notes, and a unique local id for each entry.</li>
      <li><strong>App settings:</strong> preferences such as display unit (kg/lb), chart color, reminder settings, and feature toggles.</li>
      <li><strong>Local metadata:</strong> basic metadata needed to render charts and compute stats (e.g., entry count).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Information created for backup/export</h3>
    <p>When you use the built-in backup or export features, Weightly creates files (JSON or CSV) that you can save, share, or import back into the app. These files are created on your device and are not uploaded or sent to us by the app.</p>

    <h3>2.3 Optional third-party data</h3>
    <p>The app may optionally use third-party services (see section 6). These services may collect device or usage information as described by their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>3. How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core app functionality:</strong> Local data is used solely to provide the app’s features — display stats, charts, reminders, and enable backup/restore.</li>
      <li><strong>Backups & exports:</strong> Files you create are for your own use. You control where they are saved or shared.</li>
      <li><strong>Reminders:</strong> If you enable reminders, the app schedules local notifications on your device; notification settings are stored locally.</li>
      <li><strong>Support & debugging:</strong> If you choose to report a bug, you may optionally include an exported file or logs; we will only receive data you explicitly share.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Sharing and disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes. The only circumstances where data could be shared are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you choose to export or share a backup/CSV file yourself.</li>
      <li>If you explicitly send app logs, backups, or support data to us to help troubleshoot an issue.</li>
      <li>When required by law or to respond to legal process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Advertising & analytics (optional)</h2>
    <p>If the app includes advertisements (for example, Google AdMob), those third-party providers may collect anonymous device and usage data to serve and personalize ads. If you enable or install a version of Weightly that uses ads, please review the ad provider's privacy policy for details. For Google, see: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy & Terms</a>.</p>

    <h2>6. Third-party services</h2>
    <p>Weightly may use third-party SDKs or platform services for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Advertising (e.g., Google Mobile Ads / AdMob)</li>
      <li>In-app billing (Google Play Billing)</li>
      <li>Local notifications (system notification APIs)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each third-party service has its own privacy policy. We recommend reviewing those policies for specifics about data collection and processing by those providers.</p>

    <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app. Exported backups remain wherever you choose to save them (for example, cloud storage or local files). If you delete data within the app, it is removed from the device storage; however, previously exported files that you shared or saved are not deleted by the app.</p>

    <h2>8. How to control, export, or delete your data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Export/Backup:</strong> Use the app's Backup or Export to CSV feature to create files you can save or share.</li>
      <li><strong>Restore:</strong> Use Restore or Import to load data from a previously created backup (JSON/CSV).</li>
      <li><strong>Delete records:</strong> You can delete individual entries or use the "Delete all records" option to clear stored data. The app will ask for confirmation before permanent deletion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable technical precautions to protect data stored by the app on your device. However, no storage method is 100% secure. If you enable backups to cloud services yourself, security of those files depends on the service you use.</p>

    <h2>10. Children's privacy</h2>
    <p>Weightly is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child provided personal information to Weightly, please contact us and we will help remove that information.</p>

    <h2>11. International transfers</h2>
    <p>Because Weightly stores data locally on your device by default, cross-border transfer is controlled by your actions (e.g., if you share or upload a backup to a cloud provider). If third-party services are used (ads, billing), those services may transfer or process data internationally according to their own policies.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the effective date at the top of the page. Continued use of the app after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
